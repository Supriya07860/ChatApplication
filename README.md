Setting up a server and client, connecting them, and putting the message capabilities in place are the processes involved in creating a Java chat programme. This is a brief overview of how to use Java to develop a basic chat application:

Configuring the server:
Make an application on the server that watches for incoming connections from users.
To construct a server socket and manage individual client connections, use Java's ServerSocket class and Socket class, respectively.
Use threading to manage several client connections at once.

Establishing a client:
Make a client programme that communicates with the server.
Make use of Java's Socket class to connect to the server.
To send and receive messages between the client and server, implement input and output streams.

Protocol for Messaging:
Describe a basic message protocol that the client and server can use to communicate.
You may, for instance, implement a simple text-based protocol in which newline characters are used to separate messages conveyed as strings.

Interface for Users (Optional):
For a more user-friendly chat experience, you can utilise Java Swing or JavaFX to create a graphical user interface (GUI).
Alternatively, if you prefer simplicity, you can continue using a command-line interface (CLI).

Error Resolution:
To handle several exceptions that could arise during network communication, such as connection failures or I/O errors, implement error handling.
